# Changes on this fork

* Mostly based on needs, reviewing from git log, I can list the following major changes:
  - Changing the .yaml extension to .json because the content was in JSON format.
  - Changing the SAPI Voice to female
  - Changes for finding asteroids of interest (logic and process here changed quite a bit, I also debugged and used ipdb as an analogous way of Ruby's binding.pry; it helped a lot).
  - Updated the mining bot by adding new arguments I needed, such as ratios for different asteroids and afterburner (but I think it needs more testing). And as for that shield, I currently don't mine in low or nullsec that much and I need to figure out that EnemyScanner.
  - Also, needed to change that step naming in driver.py for use with ipdb.

# eve-memory-reader

This is mostly a passion project inspired by https://github.com/Arcitectus/Sanderling with the aim of being faster and more memory efficient.

This project is split into 2 parts:
- eve-memory-reader: written in C, performs all the memory crawling and resolving tasks, returns json-like responses (UI components) to the caller
- eve-bot-framework: written in Python, provides a few things:
  - a high-level entrypoint for bots (written in yaml, and by that logic also json). Check here for [some examples](https://github.com/jamesalbert/eve-memory-reader/tree/main/eve-bot-framework/examples)
  - a UI for loading these bot configurations in
  - send you SMS messages when certain events occur


There are also 2 additional folders:
- eve-memory-reader-test: a simple invocation of eve-memory-reader so that we can perform memory leak analysis, code coverage, general testing.
- orchestration: a minimal setup for standing up a windows machine with steam installed using Vagrant and Ansible.

## Installation

```
# build the dll
nuget restore .
msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release .

# build the exe
pip install -r eve-bot-framework/requirements.txt
pyinstaller --clean --onefile --name="eve-bot-application" --paths ".\eve-bot-framework" --add-data=".\x64\Release\eve-memory-reader.dll;." .\eve-bot-framework\app\app.py
```

You should now be able to run `./dist/eve-bot-application.exe` and see two windows open:

It should automatically detect the Eve process if it's running.

The flask server is used to capture pause, stop, and healthcheck events that can interrupt the execution of a bot.

The UI window is used for end-user ease of use. Click browse, use one of the examples to get started.

That's pretty much it. When you start the bot, it will switch to the Eve window and perform actions.
